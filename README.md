# 🧵 Threaded Prime Number Search in Java

This project is a **multi-threaded prime number search program** built in **Java 17**.  
It creates `X` number of threads to search for prime numbers up to `Y`.  
The values `X` (number of threads) and `Y` (upper search limit) are **configurable via a file**.

---

## ⚙️ **Configuration File (`config.txt`)**
Set the number of threads (`X`) and the search range (`Y`) in the `config.txt` file:  
X [number]
y [number]
